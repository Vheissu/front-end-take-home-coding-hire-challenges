### The brief

Create a basic UI that allows names to be added into an imaginary hat and then allow people to randomly pick a name.

- The user enters a name and hits enter to add it to an array called `names` a name is a basic string.
- The same name cannot be added twice
- A button in the UI to draw out a name from the hat should remove it from the `names` array so that it cannot be drawn again. The name picked should be displayed to the user and then disappear after 5 seconds.
