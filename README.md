# Non-algorithm take home coding challenges
A repository of take home real world code hiring challenges that do not involve writing algorithms or other computer science nonsense.

### It's time to change the way we interview and assess potential front-end coding hires

Chances are as a developer you have gone to an interview and been subjected to a techncial interview where you have been asked to do different tasks, ranging from answering low-level questions about a language or writing a bubble sort algorithm on a whiteboard.

The purpose of this repository is to provide companies looking to hire developers, sane and realistic take home hiring challenges. These take home challenges are not time consuming or unreasonable.

## Rules for a successful outcome

- Allow the candidate to take the test home.
- All coding challenges are to be CSS, HTML and Javascript only.
- The user should not be constrained to a specific framework or library.
- Constraints such as not being able to use existing libraries and having to write everything from scratch are not allowed.

## After the challenge has been completed

- Determine if the candidate has met the brief and completed the challenge.
- Assess the code on real world criteria; does it work, is it clean, will it work in different browsers/devices, did they plagarise their code
