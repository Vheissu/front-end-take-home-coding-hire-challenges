Recommended completion time: 1 day

### The brief

Consume data from the Hacker News JSON API (not rate limited and does not require authentication) and display it. This can be built using any framework or library you want, or just vanilla Javascript if you like.

The app should at a minimum load the popular submissions currently on the Hacker News homepage and display them in any way you like. We recommend using a preexisting CSS library like Bootstrap or Material Design to help styling the submissions in your application.
